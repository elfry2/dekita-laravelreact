# End-Tree
## Overview
An end-tree specifies what ends need to be attained for the attainment of a parent end.

An end in the everyday sense is a goal, an objective to be attained. In this context, however, an end is not the desire, but rather the object being desired. For instance, if the desire is _I want to drink water_, then the end here is _water_.

An end may have children. A child is an end that has to be attained before its parent, if the parent is to be attained.

An end may have siblings. A sibling is an alternative to each other in terms of the order of attainment. The attainment of an end must not depend on the attainment of its siblings. Therefore, no specific order must necessarily be followed.

In the tree, each line is an end. Ends on the same depth are siblings, whereas those on a lower depth are children to the end immediately above it.

Ideally, an end tree must specify every end required for the attainment of the primary end, but this is impossible, and isn't very beneficial anyway. Therefore it should be considered good enough if it has successfully made the order of attainment obvious.
