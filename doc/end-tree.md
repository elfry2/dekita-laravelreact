# End-Tree
## Overview
An end-tree specifies what ends need to be done before an end.

An end is a goal, an objective to be attained.

An end may have children. A child is an end that has to be attained before its parent, if the parent is to be attained.

An end may have siblings. A sibling is an alternative to each other in terms of the order of attainment. The attainment of an end must not depend on the attainment of its siblings. Therefore, no specific order must necessarily be followed.

In the tree, each line is a node. Nodes on the same depth are siblings, whereas those on a lower depth are children to the immediately node above it.
